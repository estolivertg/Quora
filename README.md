When its day and i'm sitting, sometimes(almost every day) my eyes start to shake a lot from one side to another and so on and its really hard to focus on something, but when i do, it still keeps shaking and in some time i can just see how reality turns into a dream and i wake up a few seconds or minutes after dreaming(others say my eyes have been shaking all the time i  was sleeping). I also see wierd shapes, hear sounds before falling alseep and after waking. It's also REALLY REALLY hard for me to wake up and I can't fall asleep instantly(30mins-5h)
